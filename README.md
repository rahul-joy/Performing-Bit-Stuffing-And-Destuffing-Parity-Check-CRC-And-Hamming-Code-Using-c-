1. TITLE OF THE PROJECT PROPOSAL
Performing Bit Stuffing And Destuffing , Parity Check,CRC And Hamming Code Using c++
2. PROBLEM DOMAIN & MOTIVATIONS
The motivation behind this project is to provide a comprehensive set of error detection and
correction techniques to mitigate these issues. Each technique in the toolbox serves a specific
purpose and has its advantages and limitations. By implementing these techniques, the project
aims to:
● Ensure Data Integrity
● Enhance Data Reliability
● Provide Flexibility
● Enable Evaluation and Comparison
By addressing these motivations, the Error Detection and Correction Toolbox contributes to
improving the reliability and integrity of data during transmission and storage, which is crucial in
various domains such as telecommunications, networking, storage systems, and critical data
applications.
3. OBJECTIVES/AIMS
The main objective of data communication is to enable seamless exchange of databetween any
two points in the world. This exchange of data takes place over computer network. Data refers
to the raw facts that are collected whileinformation refers toprocessed data that enables us to
take decisions.
● The main objective of this project is to create a basic data communication system using
c++.
● To attain knowledge about Bit stuffing, Destuffing, CRC, Parity check and hamming dist.
● To have more accurate and detailed vision of the future project.
4. TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES
Ensure Data Integrity
● C++ Programming Language: The project will be implemented using C++ programming
language, which is widely used for system-level programming and provides low-level
control over memory and data manipulation.
● Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can choose any popular C++ IDE
based on your preference and operating system. Some popular options include:
● Visual Studio: A powerful IDE developed by Microsoft.
● Code::Blocks: An open-source cross-platform IDE.
● Documentation
● Testing Framework
● Build System
● Text Editors
These are some of the commonly used tools and technologies for C++ development. Depending
on your project's specific requirements and goals, you may choose additional libraries or
frameworks to enhance functionality or improve the development process.
5. CONCLUSION
There is usually the situation of measuring the instability of data transmission within a
specified time in the process of computer network communication. In order to transmit
information accurately and reliably, the communication is more secure and the signal is more
stable. In general, most of the researchers take the corresponding error control measures in the
communication network. CRC algorithm is an effective method to detect network communication
errors.
